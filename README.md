# Gravity Forms Ready Class Selector

A fork of the outdated Ready Class Selector Plugin for Gravity Forms on WordPress.

(Original Plugin: [https://wordpress.org/plugins/gravity-forms-css-ready-selector/](https://wordpress.org/plugins/gravity-forms-css-ready-selector/))

#### Version 2.1:
* Forked by Mike Kormendy
* Removes extraneous instantiation ('gform\_editor\_js' action hook already takes care of only loading this addon where appropriate â€“ hint: only the gform editor page)
* Cleans up styles to be consistent with Gravity Forms admin styles
* Reformats style indenting (compressing the style code here makes it hard to read and has no extreme benefit)
* Removes accordion collapsing of options (reducing the amount of steps to perform task)

#### Version 2.0:
* Ported to GitHub Repo by Bryan Willis ([https://github.com/bryanwillis/gravityforms-ready-class-selector-revised](https://github.com/bryanwillis/gravityforms-ready-class-selector-revised))
* Fixes errors created by the plugin.
* Removes a lot of unneeded code.
